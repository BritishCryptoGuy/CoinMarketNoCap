## Description

This project was a chance for me to explore my skills in React in order to create a website mimicking other crypto websites such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The website will display the top 100 cryptos and certain information about each. Also the user may add cryptos to their watchlist to keep an eye on them.
